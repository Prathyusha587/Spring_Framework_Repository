Welcome all!! This is a simple menu driven console Java application that allows a user to perform CRUD(CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) 
operations on a Student database, thereby understand the basic working of Spring integration with Object Relational mapping(ORM) tool,
in this case, I picked up HIBERNATE. 

This project is built using:
1. Java - Programming Language
2. Maven - Project management Tool
3. Eclipse IDE - Development environment
4. MySQL - Relational database
5. Spring Hibernate using **HibernateTemplate** class of Spring framework.

Once you import all files from this project folder, the below are the output screenshots that appear on running App.java file:

2. Choice 1: Add a new Student to Student table

These are the basic CRUD operations performed on MySQL database using Hibernate as an interface to interact with it.
Thank You !!
